The very idea of building DuoNB Alliance is hatched among Allen You, ZoomQuiet, and Chance Jiang, who have been product and tech pioneers in smart home, software engineering and connected products. Since 2019, they&amp;rsquo;ve been engaging more and more individual and organizational members, with their respective expertise and services, who&amp;rsquo;re committed to help each other along the DuoPlus Principles for connected product design.</description></item><item><title>Events</title><link>/events/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 08:49:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>/events/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>/contact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 19:25:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>/contact/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Connecting passion, making a difference&amp;rdquo; There are many ways you can engage with DuoNB Alliance and communities, from subscribing to newsletter and waiting passively for digest update, to chair a sub-group and host a theme or topic that can drive your networking efforts for fun and business.
