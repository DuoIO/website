# Call apps

1. [*Lark*](https://larksuite.com) app is recommended for participants living outside China to join our calls. It offers excellent performance for connecting users living in China who're using [*Feishu/飞书*](https://feishu.cn) app. Because both apps are built by the same parent company, [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com).

2. Alternatively, we may use [*Zoom*](https://zoom.us) for calls as well.
